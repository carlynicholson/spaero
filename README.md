## Tech Stack
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Additional Libraries
 - [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)
 - [Animate.css](https://animate.style/)
 - [AOS](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/)


## API Reference
I've leveraged the [Skyscanner Flight Search](https://rapidapi.com/skyscanner/api/skyscanner-flight-search) API to pull flight data, including quotes, places, carriers, and currencies.


## How to Use
To use this app, a user must know the origin and destination airport codes, and their departure and return dates for their desired trip. They can then search for available flights within their specifications. 


## Future Plans
- Integrate the [City Geo-Location Lookup](https://rapidapi.com/dev132/api/city-geo-location-lookup/) API for imroved UX purposes
- Create setup so that clicking "Book" on flights list page redirects user to carrier's website
- Integrate filtering capabilities so users may search for flights based on departure/arrival times, booking cost, and airlines


## Code Example 
The [Skyscanner Flight Search](https://rapidapi.com/skyscanner/api/skyscanner-flight-search) API returns the below data for flights from San Francisco International airport going to John F. Kennedy International airport.
